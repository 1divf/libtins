       libtins v1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------- About ---------------------------------

libtins is a C++ library for crafting, sending, sniffing and 
interpreting raw network packets.

Its main purpose is to provide the C++ developer an easy, efficient, 
platform and endianess-independent way to create tools which need to 
send, receive and manipulate specially crafted packets. 

In order to read tutorials, examples and checkout some benchmarks which 
show libtins' actual performance, please visit:

------------------------------- Compiling ------------------------------

In order to compile, execute:

./configure
make

Note that by default, only the shared object is compiled. If you would
like to generate a static library file as well, run:

./configure --enable-static

The generated static/shared library files will be located in the .libs
directory.

If you want to enable C++11 features, such as move semantics, use the
--enable-c++11 switch:

./configure --enable-c++11

------------------------------ Installing-------------------------------

Once you're done, if you want to install the header files and the 
shared object, execute as root:

make install

This will install the shared object typically in /usr/local/lib. Note
that you might have to update ldconfig's cache before using it, so 
in order to invalidate it, you should run(as root):

ldconfig

------------------------------ Examples --------------------------------

You might want to have a look at the examples located  in the "examples"
directory. The same samples can be found online at:
