PDU is used.

- IP, TCP and UDP now calculate the checksum everytime they're 
serialized.

- Added PDU::rfind_pdu.

- Defined several exception types.

- Implemented matches_response on several protocols.

- PacketSender is now movable.

- Added an overload of add_option that takes an rvalue-reference in IP, 
TCP, DHCP, ICMPv6 and Dot11.

- Added support for GNU/kFreeBSD.

- Removed several deprecated methods, such as PDU::clone_packet.

- Added PacketSender::send(PDU&, NetworkInterface).

- Normalized the TLV options naming conventions in all of the classes
that used them.
